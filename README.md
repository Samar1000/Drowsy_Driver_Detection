# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Accident Prevention System
 This project is based on the Embedded Systems and image processing. Using
 Raspberry Pi and Atmega32 to develop a drowsiness detection and alerting
 System that can park the car in case of deep sleep or unconsciousness to
 prevent accidents. The system also provides more protection by seatbelt and
 mobile detection and engine overheat alarm. 

## Mechanism:
  - Raspberry pi using camera will detect if driver is drowsy and alert him.
  - Bluetooth module acts as a link between Raspberry and microcontroller, it sends information from raspberry pi to microcontroller if drowsiness occurs
  - Car avoids accident by self-parking if driver didn't responce to the alert.
